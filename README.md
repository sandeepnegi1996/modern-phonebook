	- such as name and phone number
- show option to exit 



TODO
-----------
- [x] Create basic java application --> hello world 
- [x] Create basic enter option to details and option to exit 
	- [x] 1. one option to enter details

        // 4 --> exit


- [x] Create functions declaration for all the three tasks  
- [x] store data in a arraylist that too in the form of object, so for that i need one class that is of 
- [ ] Create one Class of   `User`   type to store user information 
	- [ ] `User` type and for now lets only take two fields --> `name` and `phonenumber` , and we can `phonenumber` to find a record since phonenumber will be unique for all users 


How to Run 
------------
 `javac PhoneBook.java`
 `java PhoneBook`





####  Learning
```
//override the hashcode method

    //since the datastructure suchas arraylist works in serial fashio

    //but that is not the fast way of doing this

    //so there are some datastrucutre implementation of hashTable and these datastrucuter uses hashcode to

    //to distinguish the elements
```
